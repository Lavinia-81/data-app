Connecting a JavaScript application to a Docker container with Mongo data base image and start developing.

I use JavaScript for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, which is connected to a local Docker container with a MongoDB database.

1. Builded the JavaScript application: Commit the JavaScript application to Git. This triggers a continuous integration process with Jenkins, which produces artifacts for the JavaScript application.
2. Create a Docker image: Jenkins will create a Docker image from the JavaScript artifacts.
3. Push the Docker image: Once the image is created by the Jenkins build, it is pushed to a private repository in AWS.
4. Configure the next steps: This can be done using Jenkins or other scripts and tools.
5. Deploy the Docker images: The Docker images need to be deployed on a development server. This server pulls images from the private repository, including the JavaScript application image and the MongoDB image.
6. Run the containers: There will be two containers running on the development serverâ€”one for the private container and one for the public development container. These containers communicate with each other to run the application.

### Start mongo:4.4
```
docker run -d
-p 27017:27017
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
--net mongo-network
--name mongodb
mongo:4.4
```
